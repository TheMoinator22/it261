One of my favorite books is the Handmaid's Tale, <br>
written by Margaret Atwood, and is presently a miniseries on HULU. <br>
Hulu's viewing audience is extremely excited about the miniseries and looks forward to <br>
the 5th season of the award-winning "Handmaid's Tale!" <br>

Elizabeth Moss' rendition as June is right on! I liked the show's first 2 seasons!
