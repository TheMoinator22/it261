            look to my right, and I see the hollywood sign
            this is all so crazy

            My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
            too much pressure and I'm nervous
            that's when the taxi man turned on the radio
            and a Jay-Z song was on
            and a Jay-Z song was on
            and a Jay-Z song was on
